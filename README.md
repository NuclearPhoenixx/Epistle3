# Marc Laidlaw's Epistle 3 Post. August 25th, 2017.

I'm archiving this for the world to see.

The original source is Marc Laidlaw's website, at https://www.marclaidlaw.com/epistle-3/

If you want a little more info, watch this video by ValveNewsNetwork: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urza2sbU68Q

Here you can view the original version, as well as my corrected version which has all the obfuscated names switched back to the real names.


If you want to know what I changed in the name swaps, I made a rough list here:

"Playa" 			      : "Player"

"Gertie Fremont" 	  : "Gordon Freeman"

"Gertrude Fremont" 	: "Gordon Freeman"

"Hyperborea" 		    : "Borealis"

"Mrs. X" 			      : "G-Man"

"Disparate" 		    : "Combine"

"Jerry Maas" 		    : "Judith Mossman"

"Alex Vaunt" 		    : "Alyx Vance"

"Ghastlyhaunts" 	  : "Vortigaunts"

"Elly Vaunt" 	    	: "Eli Vance"

"Tocsin Island"     : "Aperture Science"
