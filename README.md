# Marc Laidlaw's Epistle 3 Post. August 25th, 2017.

This is an active fork of Jackathan/MarcLaidlaw-Epistle3 where I try to maintain the whole thing and merge the original pull requests and stuff.

I'm archiving this for the world to see.

The original source is Marc Laidlaw's website, at https://www.marclaidlaw.com/epistle-3/ However, the immense traffic has killed his site. You can view a Wayback Machine version of that page, or the hosted version here on GitHub.

If you want a little more info, watch this video by ValveNewsNetwork: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urza2sbU68Q

Here you can view the original version, as well as my corrected version which has all the obfuscated names switched back to the real names.


If you want to know what I changed in the name swaps, I made a rough list here:

"Playa" 			      : "Player"

"Gertie Fremont" 	  : "Gordon Freeman"

"Gertrude Fremont" 	: "Gordon Freeman"

"Hyperborea" 		    : "Borealis"

"Mrs. X" 			      : "G-Man"

"Disparate" 		    : "Combine"

"Jerry Maas" 		    : "Judith Mossman"

"Alex Vaunt" 		    : "Alyx Vance"

"Ghastlyhaunts" 	  : "Vortigaunts"

"Elly Vaunt" 	    	: "Eli Vance"

"Tocsin Island"     : "Aperture Science"
